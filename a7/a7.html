      In this assignment, I provide an overview and projected timeline for my final project.

      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EJuojIdXYAAHr7Q?format=jpg&name=4096x4096" alt="">

      <p>Over the past year, a new trend of introducing different realistic textures (Skeuomorphism) was brought back to Dribbble in the form of "Neumorphism"</p>
         
      <p>Inspired by the monotone and minimalistic aesthetic, I want to create a series of interfaces by creating each interface component as thin shapes and overlapping them onto a each canvas. </p>

      <img src="./sketch.jpg" alt="">
         
      <p>A good look-a-like example of this would be the interfaces shown in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtSM2F_LQGc" class="ext-link">Microsoft Yammer trailer</a>.</p>

      <h3>Potential Interfaces</h3>

      <p>To create designs that feel more relatable and timeless. I started sketching typical desktop interface layouts we encounter everyday.</p>

      <img src="./ideas.jpg" alt="">

      <p>To have some visual variance within this series, I will be creating a messaging interface, browser interface (with a masonry layout), and a productivity tool interface.</p>

      <h3>Implementation Details</h3>

      <h4>Material</h4>
      <p>The backboard will be 3d printed using a white filament. If the final board is designed to be bigger than the print bed, the board will be cut up into smaller chunks and connected together with printed joints.</p>
      <p>To create a more organic feel to this artwork, I will most likely be casting each of the UI components using plaster (unless I find a better material).</p>

      <h4>Overlapping Components</h4>
      <p>To create a nice depth using cast shadows, each overlapping component will be fastened using a screw. The screws will also need to be long enough if there are multiple layers.</p>

      <h4>Projected Timeline</h4>
      <p><b>05/20–05/23: </b>Finalize UI designs including dimensions on Figma and purchase all of the required materials.</p>

      <p><b>05/24: </b>Convert the components from SVGs into 3D models in Rhino.</p>

      <p><b>05/25–05/27: </b>3D print every single mold required.</p>

      <p><b>05/28–06/02: </b>Cast the components required and fasten them onto the interface.</p>

      <p><b>06/03: </b>Write up process and submit assignment.</p>

      <h4>Contingency Plans</h4>

      <p><b>Option A: </b>In the situation where I don't have time to finish a series of screens1, I can scale down the scope of the project by only creating one interface. I can also adjust the complexity of the one interface by adding more details (depending on the time remaining).</p>

      <p><b>Option B: </b>In the case where I don't have enough material / time to mold and cast the componenets, I will 3D print all of the compoenents instead.</p>
